# CyberHunterz  

A deep learning model that hunts for harmful files based on structural analysis  


## Cyber Challenges  
- modernization in terms of cloud adoption  
- difficulty to maintain a SOC (Security Operations Center)  
- managing cybersecurity is difficult due to increased signal quantity ( amount of people acessing an application or executing a certain process has increased )  
- Collection is not Detection ( anywhere there is a log, its monitored and made sure nothing suspecious is occuring, but not all of these log sources is good enough, data Hygeine is a main issue, which logs are really important and which are the vital data sets to be monitored, consequences of over collection include costs, SOC fatigue, storage, regulatory restrictions )   
- understanding the trends in the market and adapting your security setup accordingly

    * Receive alerts of suspicious activity  
    * Machine Learning to correlate raw events  
    * Vulnerability management  
- Security Information and Event Management  SIEM  
    * Unified view and management of security related signals  
    * Investigation platform for suspicious activity  
    * Hunting platform to find emerging threats  
    * Receive alerts and create new detections  
- Security Orchestration Automation and Response  SOAR  
    * Low-code / No-code automation building tools  
    * Powerful tool for data enrichment automatically or on demand  
    * Automate alert triaging to reduce false positives  
    * Integrate with multiple platforms  
- Languages used in building detections  
    * Kusto Query Language (KQL)  
    * Splunk Search Processing Language (SPL)  
    * PowerShell
    * Python  
    * JSON  



## Notes


Machine Learning Systems automatically learn programs from data.  
The code of the program is inferred from data  



Security Applications of ML  
- Fraud detection system  
- Network anomaly detection  
- Network security monitoring  

Types of Network security monitoring  
- Alert-based  
- Exploration based  
- Big data security analytics (BDSA)  


Data Engineering Required  
- Databases and SQL  
- Big data with spark and hadoop  
- machine learing  
- ETL and data pipelines  
- Data warehousing  
- Build a data platform for Cybersecurity Data analytics  
- ML-ops

Product End Goal  
- A system  that can be deployed across the organisation landscape having ML models that evolves continously in detecting cybersecurity issues and does required resolution and alerting  


## Components  



Elasticsearch: 	 full-text search and analysis engine, based on the Apache Lucene search engine.  
Logstash:	 log aggregator that collects data from various input sources,  
		 executes different transformations and enhancements and then ships the data to various supported output destinations.  
Kibana:        	 visualization providing users with the ability to analyze and visualize the data on top of elasticsearch.  
Beats: 		 lightweight agents that are installed on edge hosts to collect different types of data for forwarding into the stack.


DL Model: 





Technologies Used:  
- Golang, TypeScript, NodeJS, Python  
- REST & gRPC microservices  
- React  
- Pytorch  
- Docker, Kubernetes, Kafka, Kubeflow  
- Spark  
- ELK  
- Helm, Operators

# CyberHunter  


A deep learning model that hunts for harmful files based on structural analysis  




## Notes


Machine Learning Systems automatically learn programs from data.  
The code of the program is inferred from data  



Security Applications of ML  
- Fraud detection system  
- Network anomaly detection  
- Network security monitoring  

Types of Network security monitoring  
- Alert-based  
- Exploration based  
- Big data security analytics (BDSA)  



## Components  



Elasticsearch: 	 full-text search and analysis engine, based on the Apache Lucene search engine.  
Logstash:	 log aggregator that collects data from various input sources,  
		 executes different transformations and enhancements and then ships the data to various supported output destinations.  
Kibana:        	 visualization providing users with the ability to analyze and visualize the data on top of elasticsearch.  
Beats: 		 lightweight agents that are installed on edge hosts to collect different types of data for forwarding into the stack.
